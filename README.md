# Sakshee's Personal Portfolio

Hi there! Welcome to my personal portfolio repository.

## Project Overview

This portfolio is a compilation of my work and skills, designed to give you insight into my technical expertise. I’ve also added links to my profiles on LinkedIn, GitHub, and other relevant platforms so you can connect with me and explore more of my work.

## Template Credit

This portfolio was created using a template available on the main branch. Special thanks to the creator(s) of the template for making this available! The original template repository can be found [here](https://nextfolio-template.vercel.app/). I’ve customized the template to suit my style and showcase my projects.

## Branch Information
